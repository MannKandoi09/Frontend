let name = "Mann";   //Let is used to Declare a Variable
const age = 20;     //Const is for Constants(values that don't change)
var city = "Vadodara";   // var is  an older way to declare a varaiable

// let is used when you want to reassign the value of a variable later.

// const is used when the value should not change after it's assigned.

// var is an older keyword, but it still works. It's best to use let or const in modern code.
